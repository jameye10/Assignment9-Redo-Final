<p>MVC stand for Model, View, Controller. MVC separates its applications into these three different components,
  which each work together to display the application. As it pertains to assignment 9, the following goes in depth to explain each one
  of these individually, as well as talking about a service layer.
</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Model</h3>

<p>The model is where the data is usually stored in an application. It is that simple. In assignment 9, there is a hot dog model, 
  as well as a profile model. Both of these contain properties which allow certain fileds to store information, as well 
  require certain information to be inputed. Such include a profile name, biography, and picuter, as well as a 
  favorite hot dog, where you last ate it, and your rating of it.
</p>

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Controller</h3>

<p>The controller simply sends commands to the model as well as to corresponding views. In this project, there 
  is a profile controller that has methods for index, details, create, and edit. As said before,
  each of these relate to a specific view.
</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The View</h3>

<p>The view displays the data that is stored in the model. In this assignment is shows the views for the index,
details, create, and edit methods. This is where the html code is written for the page.
</p>

<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Service Layer</h3>

<p>The service layers acts as an intermediary between the controller and the model. This is what allows
  you to store information on the page without a direct database, which is shown in this. There are two
  service class, which are hotdog and profile service.
